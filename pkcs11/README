This is the PKCS#11 provider of the opensc project.

It is still in an embryonic state, but it is possible to issue
RSA/SHA1 signatures using a fully initialized card with a private
key and at least on certificate.

Installation

In order to build the beast, try

 ant all

in the root directory. This script will automagically
fetches some popular java libraries via http, if called for the
first time.

Please note, that when running main methods or JUnit tests
the project you must supply the command line argument

-Djava.library.path=<opensc-java-root>/dist

to the java virtual machine in order to locate the jni
plugin libopensc-PKCS1-0.1.so resp. opensc-PKCS1-0.1.dll

Eclipse integration
-------------------

If you like to use the PKCS11 provider inside an eclipse
project, you should import the file
  
  dist/opensc-PKCS11-<os>-<arch>-0.1.zip

as a new eclipse project by using the

  File->Import->Import existing project into workspace->
    archive file

facility of eclipse. Afterwards, you should select the new
project opensc-PKCS11 as a referenced project insode your
own JAVA project.

Developping opensc-PKCS11
-------------------------

opensc-PKCS11 comes with the necessary project files for
using the SVN-tree as an eclipse project.

The file conf/eclipse/TestProvider.launch contain a complete
'Run...' configuration for the JUnit test case.
