This is the PKCS#11 provider of the opensc project.

It is still in an embryonic state, but it is possible to issue
RSA/SHA1 signatures using a fully initialized card with a private
key and at least on certificate.

Before building, please populate the library subdiretories with
some well-known JAVA libraries (or put a symbolic link there...)
as outlined below:

java/lib
|-- commons-logging.jar
`-- log4j.jar
test/lib/
`-- junit.jar

In order to build the beast, try

 ant all

in the root directory. Please note, that when running
the project you must supply the command line argument

-Djava.library.path=<opensc-java-root>/dist

to the java virtual machine in order to locate the jni
plugin jniP11-0.1
