 - Expose specialized key classes, which implemente the respective
   interfaces:

     PKCS11RSAPrivateKey, PKCS11DSAPrivateKey
     PKCS11RSAPublicKey, PKCS11DSAPublicKey

     (more key classes may follow, if someone implements symmetric
      ciphers or elliptic cureve algorithms...)

 - Make Ecryption work by acquiring a signature on the provider from
   SUN or bouncycastle.org
 
 - Implement key pair generation and storing of certificates, which
   involve presenting a SO pin to the card.
