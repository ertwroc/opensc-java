Before you start the IDE, you will need to make sure, that two environment variables are set:

JAVA_HOME       must point to the root directory of your JDK installation (e.g. C:\Programme\Java\jdk1.5.0_06)
OPENSC_HOME     must point to the root directory of your OpenSC installation (e.g. C:\c\opensc)

Environment variables can be set using the SET command from the command shell or in the system settings
