OpenCS PKCS#11 provider keystore.

If you like to deliver a binary packge of the OpenSC PKCS#11 provider
you must get hold of the keystore, which provides the code signing
certificate for the OpenSC project.

Most likely, you should have gained SVN write access to the OpenSC
repositories by contactin the opensc-devel mailing lists and by
actively contributing code to the OpenSC project.

If you have SVN write access, you might ask Andreas Jellinghaus for
providing you the follwing two files, which comprise the OpenSC
keystore: opensc-pkcs11.keystore, opensc-pks11.txt
